# quant_strats

Tl;dr Exploration of quant strategies.

This repository is supposed to be my playground with testing quant strategies that 
I already know / come across in papers. The source from where the strategy was inspired from will be linked in the respective folder. 

I will try and include how I explored the data, how I thought about creating the signal,
how I backtested the strategy, and document the decisions I make along the way.


## Structure

* `data/` : Contain work primarily regarding data collection and retreival 
 to use when creating/testing strategies. 
* `analytics/` : Will include some common methods to test the performance of strategies.
* `strat/` : Will be the home where the strategy will be explored, created, and tested.

\* Note that the proposed structure might change as the repository grows organically.

## Examples

This section will include examples of how to use strategies highlighted in
the `strat/` folder.
